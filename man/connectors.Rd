\description{
connectors

draws bezier connectors between pairs of signed points points a = (x0, y0, s0) and b(x1, y1, s1)

"S" connectors will use bezier control points that are located in an intermediate y location
between y0 and y1, and "U" connectors will use bezier control points that are located in an
intermediate x location between x0 and x1.

type can be "U" or "S", if "S", then sign of corresponding v value is ignored (ie control points will always
be vertically in between a and b, in addition, neither intermeidate control will never be more than 1/3 of the y distance
between a and b

The sign of the endpoints refers to the direction from which the connector approaches the point, s0 = 1 (or '+') means from the right
and s0 = 0 means from the left, similarly for s1

h = horizonal "bulge" of signed connector, ie depending on the sign the extent to which the connector will extend to the left
or the right of points an and b
v = vertical bulge (only applies to U connectors), how far above max(y0, y1) the U connector will bulge if v>0 or how far below min(y0, y1)
the connector will bulge.

nsteps determines how many segments used to approximate the curve

all args except nsteps can be vecorized
